In this project, I used Viterbi algorithm, Likelihood Weighted Sampling algorithm and Forward-Backward algorithm. Results of these algorithms are similar. But on Mac's jupyter notebook and in terminal, results of Likelihood Weighted Sampling seems to be different for the same dataset and same number of iterations.
